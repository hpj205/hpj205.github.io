game inspired by the "good pizza great pizza","papa's pizzeria" franchise,animal restaurant and similar mobile games!

instructions:
- wait for the project to load. reload the page if needed!
- press start. sometimes its weird, you might need to press on the word "to" in the image
- drag and drop the animals requested menu items from the smaller table onto the larger serving table. press the serve button.
- u have 30s to serve as many dishes as possible

any major challenges
and a reflection on the development of your technical understanding.


this project was a challenge because i aimed to create a rly complex restaurant game but i couldn't figure out how to implement everything so it ended up becoming more of a "give the animals anything" game. the points system become an "animals served" system, orders became preferences, and there's no way to win or lose.
i had to look at a lot of tutorials for my initial idea, and ended up changing the idea multiple times until i settled on this one, which was within my skill level but still posed a challenge.
the drag and drop was intimidating to me at first, but after looking online i realized it wasnt as intimidating as i thought it was. i found it difficult to implement but once i had it sorted, i realized it was a really useful tool for future projects and i was glad i took the time to learn them.
i had to look at arrays and watch multiple videos on them, then the drag and drop mechanics i struggled with and had to look at multiple videos and online tutortials, object communication and distance. i also had a look at game states.
it was a fun project to experiment new concepts and to create some art as well, which i think helped my overall understanding of how to create a basic game, and also my skill level.
