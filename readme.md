functionality:

1. press start, the x and y might be more centred to the "to" in "press to start"

2. drag and drop food items to the animals. you can't get it wrong

3. serve as many customers as you can within 60 seconds

4. to restart the game, refresh the page.

inspiration:
this game is loosely inspired by game such as papa's pizzeria, good pizza great pizza, and other restaurant based mobile games. the idea came from my little sister who asked for a "mcdonalds" game with "animals".

issues:

- points system was going into the negatives, changed it into a "customers served" game
- drag and drop took the longest to program
- drawing campus in the back wasn't difficult, but time consuming.
- centering the correct mouse x and y for the start button took a while, and you need to kind of click around the start img for it to work.
- the "serve dish" button would not .show() if i wld .hide() it, so it;s visible pre game.
- when i copied it to my git repository it overwrote my readme.md, which i'd already written all my sources in, so had to manually go thru my search history and find everything i could find and re-link it here.
